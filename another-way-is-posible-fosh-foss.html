(<a href="https://boingboing.net/tag/planned-obsolescence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hello Apple, we noticed</a>). In closed source, it's much more difficult to detect unethical, malicious actions.  Open model makes possible for an independent researchers to see what's happening in source code of application, computer hardware drivers etc. Ethical hackers, penetration testers can build reputation by finding weaknesses or backdoors. It gives incentives to companies and institutions to invest in <strong>Open Software</strong> and <strong>Hardware</strong> to be able to protect their data.  </span></p><p>Back to history lesson:</p><h2><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Great story from Cory Doctrow about Galaksija PCs from Yugoslavia</span></h2><p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">In 1948, Yugoslavia was expelled from Cominform, the Soviet information agency, in retaliation for its "non-aligned" status; deprived of information-processing capacity, the country created its own IT industry from scratch. </span></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://pktch.github.io/LCC/media/posts/10//galaxija1.png" sizes="(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw" srcset="https://pktch.github.io/LCC/media/posts/10//responsive/galaxija1-xs.png 300w, https://pktch.github.io/LCC/media/posts/10//responsive/galaxija1-sm.png 480w, https://pktch.github.io/LCC/media/posts/10//responsive/galaxija1-md.png 768w" alt="" width="460" height="686"></figure><p><a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cory Doctorow </a>link to thread source : <a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1289932294023610370" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tweet thread</a></p><p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Yugoslavia's high tariffs and uneasy status on the world stage meant that by the 1970s, members of the New Wave" - science and tech enthusiasts who clustered around the sf/electronic mag Galaksija - could only play with PCs by pooling their money to import western machines.<br>In the 1980s, "digital electronics enthusiast" Voja Antonić went on a Montenegro holiday with a copy of RCA's manual for a new single-chip CPU and had an inspiration for a kit-based PC that revolutionized Yugoslavian computing: the Galaksija computer!<br></span></p><p> </p><h4><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://pktch.github.io/LCC/media/posts/10//Voja-Antonic-and-Jova-Regasek-assembling-a-Galaxija-computer-min.jpg" sizes="(min-width: 61.3125em) 50vw, 100vw" srcset="https://pktch.github.io/LCC/media/posts/10//responsive/Voja-Antonic-and-Jova-Regasek-assembling-a-Galaxija-computer-min-xs.jpg 300w, https://pktch.github.io/LCC/media/posts/10//responsive/Voja-Antonic-and-Jova-Regasek-assembling-a-Galaxija-computer-min-sm.jpg 480w, https://pktch.github.io/LCC/media/posts/10//responsive/Voja-Antonic-and-Jova-Regasek-assembling-a-Galaxija-computer-min-md.jpg 768w" alt="" width="2018" height="1293"></figure></span></h4><p class="small-text"><a>Voja Antonić </a>and his colleague Jova Regasek (left) putting together the Galaksija prototype in 1983.</p><h4><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"><br>"The Galaksija computer was a craze in 1980s socialist Yugoslavia, inspiring thousands of people to build versions in their own homes.
