<h4><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Is that vision lost? </span></h4>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Somehow when we don't appreciate what we have, someone can just come and take it (slowly).  Now we are stacked with technology gatekeepers, giant monopolies, exploited by spyware and advertisers. </span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">We are being seduced by fake idols of Silicon Valley. Mislead by corporate media. Free hardware and software have fall behind and struggling to catch up. Small adoption and investments makes it harder to use, update and innovate. Rising awareness of user abuse makes us think more about it and look for a free alternatives.     </span></p>
<h4><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">About the magic of "Open" </span></h4>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Open model for hardware and software can benefit many and spark creativity and innovation. We even have to fight today to be able to repair our devices. Computers, phones, printers can be sabotaged behind the wall (closed source) with <strong>planned obsolescence</strong>. (<a href="https://boingboing.net/tag/planned-obsolescence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hello Apple, we noticed</a>). In closed source, it's much more difficult to detect unethical, malicious actions.  Open model makes possible for an independent researchers to see what's happening in source code of application, computer hardware drivers etc. Ethical hackers, penetration testers can build reputation by finding weaknesses or backdoors. It gives incentives to companies and institutions to invest in <strong>Open Software</strong> and <strong>Hardware</strong> to be able to protect their data.  </span></p>
<p>Back to history lesson:</p>
<h2><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Great story from Cory Doctrow about Galaksija PCs from Yugoslavia</span></h2>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">In 1948, Yugoslavia was expelled from Cominform, the Soviet information agency, in retaliation for its "non-aligned" status; deprived of information-processing capacity, the country created its own IT industry from scratch. </span></p>

<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Yugoslavia's high tariffs and uneasy status on the world stage meant that by the 1970s, members of the New Wave" - science and tech enthusiasts who clustered around the sf/electronic mag Galaksija - could only play with PCs by pooling their money to import western machines.<br>In the 1980s, "digital electronics enthusiast" Voja Antonić went on a Montenegro holiday with a copy of RCA's manual for a new single-chip CPU and had an inspiration for a kit-based PC that revolutionized Yugoslavian computing: the Galaksija computer!<br></span></p>

<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">These programs spread widely thanks in part to a radio show that broadcast the computer code as audio, intended to be recorded to cassette (the main storage mechanism for the system). Zoran Modli's Ventilator 202 program broadcast hundreds of listener-supplied programs.</span></p>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">The listeners' programs were early multimedia magazines: audio, video, concert listings, ed-tech, flight sims and other games. Other listeners would record, run, and improve these and send them back to Ventilator 202 for retransmission. <br>There was a brief time where Galaksija computers were mass produced and proliferated through Yugoslavian schools and universities but were eclipsed by cheaper imports and the death of the New Wave scene during the civil wars.<br></span></p>

<h3>An Open Source Smart Phone Supported by All Major Linux Phone Projects</h3>
<p>Lot of communities are excited to develop new Linux Phone OS. They are not close to meet ordinary phone–user's expectations, but they are having very vibrant process that was enabled by #FOSH producer <strong>Pine64</strong>.  </p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://pktch.github.io/LCC/media/posts/10/Screen-Shot-2020-08-16-at-5.25.43-AM.png" alt="" width="438" height="512"></p>

<p>Perhaps you’re in a line of work where security is a must, or a hard-core Linux enthusiast, or perhaps you’ve just got enough of Android and iOS and you’re ready for something else – the PinePhone may be the next Phone for you. Powered by the same Quad-Core ARM Cortex A53 64-Bit SOC used in our popular PINE A64 Single Board Computer, the PinePhone runs mainline Linux as well as anything else you’ll get it to run.</p>
<p>The purpose of the PinePhone isn’t only to deliver a functioning Linux phone to end-users, but also to actively create a market for such a device, as well as to support existing and well established Linux-on-Phone projects. All major Linux Phone-oriented projects, as well as other FOSS OS’, are represented on the PinePhone and developers work together on our platform to bring support this this community driven device.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p><strong>SkyLift</strong> works by broadcasting MAC addresses that are associated with WiFi routers in a different location. WiFi geolocation services rely on the assumed stable location of home and commercial routers to return accurate geolocation information. Because space-based GPS signals are attenuated in dense urban areas, WiFi became a viable alternative for location services in consumer tech. However, it's also vulnerable to spoofing attacks as <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080414145659.htm">discovered by researchers at ETH Zurich/Swiss Federal Institute of Technology</a> in 2008.<br>Ten years later WiFi geolocation spoofing, surprisingly, still works.</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://pktch.github.io/LCC/media/posts/4//1-skylift_schloss_solitude_zkm.gif" alt="WiFi Geolocation Spoofing Device" width="960" height="720"></p>
<p>Made for <a href="http://wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.bitnik.org/">!Mediengruppe Bitnik’s Assange Room</a>. Developed in collaboration with <a href="http://www.suryamattu.com/">Surya Mattu</a></p>
<p>SkyLift is a WiFi geolocation spoofing device that virtually relocates visitors to Julian Assange’s residence at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. The device was made for !Mediengruppe Bitnik’s Assange room and works by broadcasting WiFi signals (beacon frames) that exploit WiFi geolocation services.</p>
<p>Thanks to a web-residency grant from <a href="https://schloss-post.com/the-future-of-living-with-surveillance/">Schloss Solitude</a> SkyLift now runs on the ESP8266, a low-cost Arduino-compatible WiFi microcontroller, and is open source. Full code and documentation on <a href="https://github.com/adamhrv/skylift">https://github.com/adamhrv/skylift</a>.</p>
<p>Previously, this technique would require a small linux computer, USB WiFi dongles, and a program such as mdk3 to broadcast beacon frames with custom MAC addresses. This was functional but less practical. The small size and low cost of the ESP8266 microcontroller offers new possibilities for creative geolocation spoofing.</p>
<h3>How it Works</h3>
<p>To get started you can follow the instructions on <a href="https://github.com/adamhrv/skylift">https://github.com/adamhrv/skylift</a> and use the provided beacon frames to virtually relocate your smartphone to Julian Assange's residence in London. Once successfully relocated, every app on your phone will think you're standing outside 3 Hans Crescent, London SW1X 0LS, even FindMyPhone and Pokemon.</p>
<p>If you'd rather go somewhere sunny, record your own locations using the instructions on GitHub.</p>
<p>SkyLift only relies on broadcasting MAC addresses. There is no IP spoofing, no GPS signal spoofing, no VPN, and no 3rd party app involved. It works for any app on your phone with location services available, including FindMyPhone (iOS) and Pokemon. It works without connecting to any WiFi network. However, it only works when you have WiFi location services enabled. And typically works best indoors (where GPS is attenutated) and in locations where nearby WiFi signals are less than -80dBm.</p>
<p>For a more thorough technical overview about how Beacon Frames work and the basic WiFi protocol information visit <a href="https://criticalengineering.org/projects/packetbridge/">PacketBridge</a> (2012), an earlier project from the Critical Engineering group using the same technique, or view the README on <a href="https://github.com/adamhrv/skylift">https://github.com/adamhrv/skylift</a>.</p>

                <p><em>MegaPixels</em> is an ongoing project about machine learning image datasets. The installation used facial recognition to search for your identity in the largest publicly available facial recognition training dataset in the world, called MegaFace (V2). Out of approximately 15,000 users, two people reported finding a positive match in the training database which they never knew existed.</p>
<p><img class="post__image" src="https://pktch.github.io/LCC/media/posts/3//megapixels.jpg" alt="MegaPixels thermal printout from Glass Room installation" width="1200" height="500"></p>
<p>What many people aren't aware of is that you might be included in this facial recognition training dataset because it was created entirely from Flickr. The dataset contains approximately 672,000 identities and 4.2 million photos, all obtained from Flickr without anyone consenting.<br><br>These 4.2 million images are currently being passed between researchers in the US, China, Russia, and all over the world to train and evaluate state-of-the-art facial recognition algorithms. If you knew that your image, your friend's image, or your child's image was being used for developing products in the defense industry, would you object? How would you even find out if your photo was included?<br><br>MegaPixels is an ongoing project to bring these datasets into the public view , provide new tools to explore their contents, and surface the ethical implications of datasets.</p>
<h2>How it Works</h2>
<p>Walk up to the MegaPixels kiosk and in a few seconds you’ll be compared to ~672,00 identities from the MegaFace dataset. The best matches will be displayed on the screen with their match confidence scores. When a similar face is found, a button illuminates and you can print out a summary of your match score along with information about the database.</p>

Modern laptops have secret schematics, glued-in batteries, and components not under user control, like the Intel Management Engine or the Apple T2 security chip. Many people decide to tape over the built-in cameras of their laptops because they don’t know if they can trust the device or the software running on it.<br><br>Reform goes in the opposite direction. It is designed to be as open and transparent as possible, and to support a free and open source software stack from the ground up. It invites you to take a look under the hood, customize the documented electronics, and even repair it youself if you like. The Reform laptop has no built-in surveillance technologies, cameras, or microphones, so you can be confident that it will never spy on you. Built not around Intel technology, but NXP i.MX8M with 64-bit ARM Cortex-A53 cores, Reform has a much simpler architecture than conventional laptops. This simplicity also makes for a more pleasant developer experience.","config":{"textAlign":"left","advanced":{"style":"","cssClasses":"","id":""}}},{"id":1597802929945,"type":"publii-header","content":"A more private computer","config":{"headingLevel":3,"textAlign":"left","link":{"url":"","noFollow":false,"targetBlank":false,"sponsored":false,"ugc":false},"advanced":{"cssClasses":"","customId":false,"id":"a-more-private-computer"}}},{"id":1597802952296,"type":"publii-paragraph","content":"Reform doesn’t have any microphones or cameras built in, and Wi-Fi is provided by a removable PCIe card.
